# Hindi-English Codemixed Named Entity Recognition (NER) using HingFT on ICON Dataset

This README provides an overview and instructions for implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Hindi-English codemixed text using the HingFT model on the ICON dataset. NER is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, etc. in text.

## Introduction

This project focuses on implementing NER for Hindi-English codemixed text. Codemixing involves the mixing of two or more languages within the same text or conversation, which is a common phenomenon in multilingual societies. The HingFT model is a pre-trained model that is specialized for Hindi-English codemixed text and can be used for NER.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.6 or later)
- PyTorch (v1.0 or later)
- Transformers library (Hugging Face Transformers)
- ICON dataset (or any suitable Hindi-English codemixed text dataset)

You can install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

## Dataset

The ICON dataset is a popular dataset for Hindi-English codemixed NER. Ensure that you have the dataset available for training and evaluation. You can download it from the [official ICON website](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/iicon/) and preprocess it as needed.

## Model

The HingFT model is a specialized model for Hindi-English codemixed text processing. You can obtain the pre-trained HingFT model from a source such as the Hugging Face Model Hub (https://huggingface.co/models) or fine-tune it on your dataset if necessary.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ner-hingft-icon.git
cd ner-hingft-icon
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download and place the pre-trained HingFT model in the `models/` directory.

## Usage

To train the NER model on the ICON dataset, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the ICON dataset to the required format for NER training.

2. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

3. Fine-tune the HingFT model on the training dataset using a script provided in the repository. Example command:

```bash
python train.py --data_path path/to/training_data --model_path path/to/pretrained_hingft_model
```

4. Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set to tune hyperparameters and improve the model.

5. Once satisfied with the model's performance, evaluate it on the test set.

## Evaluation

The evaluation metrics for NER typically include precision, recall, and F1-score. You can use standard NER evaluation tools and libraries to calculate these metrics for your model's predictions on the test dataset.

## Results

Document the results of your NER model, including the performance metrics, any challenges faced, and possible improvements.
